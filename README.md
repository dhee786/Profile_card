This is a stunning, responsive profile card featuring an animated neural network background that creates an attractive visual experience. The card showcases a modern glass-morphism design with smooth animations and interactive elements, perfect for personal portfolios or professional profiles. The implementation combines cutting-edge web technologies to deliver a visually appealing and highly engaging user interface.

**Key Features ⤵️
The profile card includes a full-screen neural network animation powered by Vanta.js, creating a dynamic 3D background that responds to user interactions. The card itself features a beautiful glass-morphism effect with translucent elements and blur effects that give it a modern, sophisticated appearance. The design is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly to all device sizes, from desktop computers to mobile phones.

**Interactive Elements ⤵️
Social media icons are color-coded to match their respective platforms and feature smooth hover animations with scaling and elevation effects. The profile image includes multiple animations including a floating effect, pulsing rings, and a rotating gradient border that creates visual interest. Statistics display and skill badges provide additional information in an aesthetically pleasing format, while all interactive elements provide smooth feedback transitions.

**Technical Implementation ⤵️
Built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, the project leverages several libraries including Vanta.js for the neural network background, Feather Icons for scalable vector icons, and AOS for scroll-triggered animations. The CSS incorporates advanced features like backdrop filters for glass-morphism effects, CSS variables for easy customization, and complex gradient animations.

**Customize Options ⤵️
The profile card is easily customizable - users can modify personal information, statistics, skill badges, social media links, and color schemes to match their personal brand. The code structure is organized with clear comments, making it straightforward to adapt for different use cases while maintaining the sophisticated visual effects.
